# Chess Engine in Java

Explore this repository housing a Java chess engine with a simple AI. 
The project facilitates local 1v1 gameplay, either against another person or an AI. Additionally, users can spectate matches between two AIs. 
The AI employs a MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and move ordering for strategic decision-making. 
While the project is a work in progress, it currently offers basic functionality and a functional AI.
